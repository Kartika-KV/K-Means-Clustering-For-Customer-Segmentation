# K-Means-Clustering-For-Customer-Segmentation
Had used K Means Clusterting for segmentation of customers into different groups using the dataset 'Mall_Customers.csv'
# Model Interpretation 
Cluster 1 (Red Color) -> earning high but spending less

cluster 2 (Blue Colr) -> average in terms of earning and spending 

cluster 3 (Green Color) -> earning high and also spending high [TARGET SET]

cluster 4 (cyan Color) -> earning less but spending more

Cluster 5 (magenta Color) -> Earning less , spending less


We can put Cluster 3 into some alerting system where email can be send to them on daily basis as these re easy to converse 
wherein others we can set like once in a week or once in a month
